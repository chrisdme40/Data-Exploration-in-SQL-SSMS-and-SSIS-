# Data-Exploration-in-SQL-SSMS-and-SSIS
In this Project, I have performed SQL queries in SQL Server Management Studio to explore and analyze the data to gain insights.
The Data consists of two parts which were cleaned and split into two separate files in covid vaccination and coviddeaths.
Covid vaccination consists of the data for number of vaccination,location etc whereas coviddeath has the data for deaths,date,location etc.
The flow of the queries is from basic intermediate to advanced where I have used Groupby,joins,Regex,cte,temptables and views. After performing queries, we analyze the output to further 
use the data for visualization and gain insights.

The data can be found in CovidDeaths updated.xlsx and Covidvaccinations updated.xlsx and the queries are saved in SQLQueries.sql.
