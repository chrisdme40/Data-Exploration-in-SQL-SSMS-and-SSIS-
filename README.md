# Data-Exploration-in-SQL-SSMS-and-SSIS-
In this Project I have perfomed SQL queries in SQL Server Management Studio to explore and analyze the data to gain insights.
The flow of the queries is from basic intermediate to advance where i have used cte,temptables and views. After performing queries we analyze the output to further 
use the data for visualization and gain insights.
